    <h1>Magic the Gathering: Color Test?</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>This tool determines which Magic: The Gathering color or color combination best represents you or a character you’ve created. By answering a series of questions, you’ll receive a result that reflects your personality, motivations, and worldview through the lens of MTG’s color philosophy.</p>
    
    <p>Many tests like the Nen and MTG tests you can find online are personality tests. You've seen them, whether you're trying to find out which Hogwarts house you belong to, or take the coporate beloved personality test. My main issue with these
      personality tests is that they are... bad? "Bad" isn't the best way to put it, but to me, they've always felt bad because I never found that the provided answers suited mine, as I would have to choose from limiting options or from a range of agree
      to disagree. What I've done here is for these tests is provided an open ended questionaire that uses sentence embedding ("a representation of a sentence as a vector of numbers") to assign point values to responses, analyzing what you've written with
      (presumably) good enough accuracy to correctly (allegedly) assign your personality.
