            Hi!
        </p>

        <p class="test1">
            One of the first things you'll probably notice about me and my projects is that the word "nerd" may come out and jump at you. And to be honest, I 
            fully embrace it. My hobbies include playing TTRPGs such as Dungeons and Dragons or Pathfinder, or the famous TCG Magic: The Gathering. I also hold 
            and express a deep love and interest in video games. Something about games has always captivated me, and to be honest, I could probably narrow it 
            down to two reasons why:
        </p>

        <ul class="test1">
            <li>First, they provide a challenge, and I, for some odd reason, like being challenged to the point of insanity. The feeling of overcoming something 
            you struggled against is euphoric, especially when it feels like you've been at your wit's end after hours of effort.</li>
            <li>Second, the mechanical and logistical perspective of games, both as a player and as a designer, is fascinating. As a developer or designer, 
            you create scenarios and systems that pose problems, while also getting the opportunity to solve them. Itâ€™s a continuous process of discovery, 
            iteration, and improvement.</li>
